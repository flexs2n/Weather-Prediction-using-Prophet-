# **Weather Prediction in San Francisco using Prophet**
This project is focused on predicting weather patterns in San Francisco, California, using the time series forecasting tool, Prophet. The goal of this project is to forecast weather conditions in San Francisco for the next few weeks.

**Data**
The data for this project was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website, which provides historical weather data for various locations across the United States. The data was preprocessed to extract relevant features such as temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed.

**Tools and Libraries Used**

1. Python 3
2. Prophet
3. Pandas
4. Matplotlib

**Usage**

Clone this repository to your local machine
Install the required libraries using pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the SF_Weather.ipynb Jupyter notebook to view the code and execute it.

**Methodology**

1. Load the historical weather data and preprocess it to extract relevant features
2. Train a Prophet model on the preprocessed data
3. Use the trained model to make predictions for the next few weeks
4. Visualize the predicted weather patterns using Matplotlib

**Results**

The predicted weather patterns for the next few weeks are visualized in the Jupyter notebook using Matplotlib. The results show the forecasted trends for temperature, pressure, humidity, and wind speed. The predictions can be used to plan outdoor activities, and to prepare for weather events such as heatwaves.

**Future Improvements (Upcoming)**

Incorporate more weather data from other sources
Use other time series forecasting methods such as ARIMA or LSTM
Improve the visualization of the predicted weather patterns
Incoporate Polars over pandas
