\section{Introduction}

This project aims to predict weather patterns using Prophet neural networks. The goal is to train the neural network on past weather data and use it to make predictions about future weather conditions.

\section{Dependencies}

To run this project, you will need the following dependencies:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Python 3.6 or higher
  \item Prophet neural network library
  \item Pandas data analysis library
  \item Matplotlib plotting library
  \item Jupyter Notebook
\end{itemize}

\section{Installation}

To install the dependencies, run the following command:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
pip install -r requirements.txt
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Usage}

To run the project, open the Jupyter Notebook and run the cells in order. The notebook contains detailed comments and explanations of each step of the process.

\section{Data}

The weather data used in this project was obtained from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website. The data covers a period of 10 years and includes temperature, precipitation, wind speed, and other weather-related variables.

\section{Results}

The results of the weather predictions are displayed in the Jupyter Notebook using Matplotlib. The predictions are compared to the actual weather data to evaluate the accuracy of the neural network.

\section{Conclusion}

This project demonstrates the potential of using Prophet neural networks for weather prediction. The accuracy of the predictions can be improved with further tuning of the neural network parameters and the inclusion of additional weather-related variables.
